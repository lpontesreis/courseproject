This is the code describing the steps provided in run_analysis.R.
First, the system finds out what is the current working directory.
After that, it will create a vector with possible names for the measurement data (it will be discarded later in the final dataset).
Then, we read the training sets and the testing sets using read.table(), which are merged using rbind.
We then read activity labels to name the columns, including also subject and activity as column names.
To replace the activity numbers with appropriate labels, we use the activity_labels.txt file and replace in the appropriate column.
Now we have a very big dataset which should be trimmed down.
Using grepl(), we keep only the columns with mean() and std() in their names.
Finally, we create a new data.frame for each subject and activity (30 subjects x 6 activities = 180 rows).
